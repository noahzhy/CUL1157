Whatever happens, there will likely be lasting negative ramifications — and not just for Chinese firms, but for American technology companies as well.Trump’s orders, signed late Thursday, have a 45-day lag.

It’s that the Covid-19 crisis’s impact, or at least the social-distancing strictures it has forced upon the world, will prove to be permanent.While not quite accepted wisdom, it’s a view coalescing in the minds of certain market watchers -- that even if the virus is defeated, the behaviors it has engendered will live on.
